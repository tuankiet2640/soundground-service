# SoundGround

SoundGround is a website inspired by SoundCloud, a platform for musicians and music enthusiasts to share and discover new music. This project showcases my skills in developing a full-stack web application using modern technologies and best practices.

## Technologies Used

### Backend

- **Java**: The core programming language used for the backend development.
- **Spring Boot**: A powerful framework for building robust and scalable Java applications.
- **Spring Data JPA**: A part of the Spring ecosystem, providing an abstraction layer over JPA (Java Persistence API) for easy database integration.
- **PostgreSQL**: A robust and open-source relational database management system.
- **Flyway**: A database migration tool for easy version control and deployment of database changes.
- **Apache Commons Lang3**: A utility library for Java, providing helpful methods for string manipulation, validation, and more.
- **Spring Security**: A comprehensive security framework for securing web applications.
- **ModelMapper**: A library for mapping objects between different layers of the application.
- **Jackson**: A high-performance JSON processor for Java.
- **Lombok**: A library that automatically generates boilerplate code (getters, setters, constructors, etc.) for Java classes.
- **Swagger**: A tool for designing, building, and documenting RESTful APIs.
- **Caffeine**: A high-performance caching library for Java.

### Frontend

- **Angular**: A powerful and flexible front-end framework for building modern web applications.
- **TypeScript**: A statically-typed superset of JavaScript, providing better tooling and improved developer experience.
- **HTML/CSS**: The standard markup and styling languages for web development.

### Testing

- **JUnit**: A popular testing framework for Java applications.
- **Mockito**: A mocking framework for unit testing in Java.

### Build and Deployment

- **Gradle**: A modern and flexible build automation tool for Java projects.
- **Docker**: A containerization platform for easy deployment and scaling of applications.
- **Kubernetes**: A container orchestration system for managing and deploying containerized applications.
- **Jenkins**: A popular open-source automation server for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

By leveraging these cutting-edge technologies, SoundGround offers a robust and scalable platform for music sharing and discovery. The project showcases my proficiency in backend development with Java and Spring Boot, frontend development with Angular, database management with PostgreSQL and Flyway, security implementation with Spring Security, and testing with JUnit and Mockito. Additionally, the use of Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins demonstrates my familiarity with modern DevOps practices for efficient...
